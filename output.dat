 Checking for sufficient met forcing data to
   complete the model simulation.  This may
   take a while, depending on how big your met
   input file is.


 You are running the large-domain Barnes oi scheme
   This requires:
   1) no missing data for the fields of interest
   2) no missing stations during the simulation
   3) met file must list stations in the same order
   4) the number of nearest stations used is 5 or less
   5)  **** no error checking for this is done ****

 Generating nearest-station index.  Be patient.
