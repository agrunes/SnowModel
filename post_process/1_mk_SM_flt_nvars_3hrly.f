c 1_mk_SM_flt_nvars_3hrly.f

c This program reads my SnowModel GrADS archive and creates
c   corresponding daily float (.flt) files.  This is an IEEE
c   floating-point format, 32-bit signed binary file (this is
c   just a y-flipped grads file) archive with one file for
c   each day, and for each variable, with each variable going
c   in a different directory.

c To convert a .flt file to a .tif file using gdalwarp, two
c   files are required: The binary floating-point file (.flt)
c   and an ASCII header file with the same name as the .flt
c   file but with a .hdr file extension.  Details of this .hdr
c   file can be found on these web sites:

c
c----------
c
c Subroutine calndr() performs calendar calculations using either
c the standard Gregorian calendar or the old Julian calendar.
c This subroutine extends the definitions of these calendar systems
c to any arbitrary year.  The algorithms in this subroutine
c will work with any date in the past or future,
c but overflows will occur if the numbers are sufficiently large.
c For a computer using a 32-bit integer, this routine can handle
c any date between roughly 5.8 million BC and 5.8 million AD
c without experiencing overflow during calculations.
c
c No external functions or subroutines are called.
c
c----------
c
c INPUT/OUTPUT ARGUMENTS FOR SUBROUTINE CALNDR()
c
c "ioptn" is the desired calendar conversion option explained below.
c Positive option values use the standard modern Gregorian calendar.
c Negative option values use the old Julian calendar which was the
c standard in Europe from its institution by Julius Caesar in 45 BC
c until at least 4 October 1582.  The Gregorian and Julian calendars
c are explained further below.
c
c (iday,month,iyear) is a calendar date where "iday" is the day of
c the month, "month" is 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.,
c and "iyear" is the year.  If the year is 1968 AD, enter iyear=1968,
c since iyear=68 would refer to 68 AD.
c For BC years, iyear should be negative, so 45 BC would be iyear=-45.
c By convention, there is no year 0 under the BC/AD year numbering
c scheme.  That is, years proceed as 2 BC, 1 BC, 1 AD, 2 AD, etc.,
c without including 0.  Subroutine calndr() will print an error message
c and stop if you specify iyear=0.
c
c "idayct" is a day count.  It is either the day number during the
c specified year or the Julian Day number, depending on the value
c of ioptn.  By day number during the specified year, we mean
c idayct=1 on 1 January, idayct=32 on 1 February, etc., to idayct=365
c or 366 on 31 December, depending on whether the specified year
c is a leap year.
c
c The values of input variables are not changed by this subroutine.
c
c
c ALLOWABLE VALUES FOR "IOPTN" and the conversions they invoke.
c Positive option values ( 1 to  5) use the standard Gregorian calendar.
c Negative option values (-1 to -5) use the old      Julian    calendar.
c
c Absolute
c  value
c of ioptn   Input variable(s)     Output variable(s)
c
c    1       iday,month,iyear      idayct
c Given a calendar date (iday,month,iyear), compute the day number
c (idayct) during the year, where 1 January is day number 1 and
c 31 December is day number 365 or 366, depending on whether it is
c a leap year.
c
c    2       idayct,iyear          iday,month
c Given the day number of the year (idayct) and the year (iyear),
c compute the day of the month (iday) and the month (month).
c
c    3       iday,month,iyear      idayct
c Given a calendar date (iday,month,iyear), compute the Julian Day
c number (idayct) that starts at noon of the calendar date specified.
c
c    4       idayct                iday,month,iyear
c Given the Julian Day number (idayct) that starts at noon,
c compute the corresponding calendar date (iday,month,iyear).
c
c    5       idayct                iday,month,iyear
c Given the Julian Day number (idayct) that starts at noon,
c compute the corresponding day number for the year (iday)
c and year (iyear).  On return from calndr(), "month" will always
c be set equal to 1 when ioptn=5.
c
c No inverse function is needed for ioptn=5 because it is
c available through option 3.  One simply calls calndr() with:
c ioptn = 3,
c iday  = day number of the year instead of day of the month,
c month = 1, and
c iyear = whatever the desired year is.
c

c
c EXAMPLES
c The first 6 examples are for the standard Gregorian calendar.
c All the examples deal with 15 October 1582, which was the first day
c of the Gregorian calendar.  15 October is the 288-th day of the year.
c Julian Day number 2299161 began at noon on 15 October 1582.
c
c Find the day number during the year on 15 October 1582
c     ioptn = 1
c     call calndr (ioptn, 15, 10, 1582,  idayct)
c calndr() should return idayct=288
c
c Find the day of the month and month for day 288 in year 1582.
c     ioptn = 2
c     call calndr (ioptn, iday, month, 1582, 288)
c calndr() should return iday=15 and month=10.
c
c Find the Julian Day number for 15 October 1582.
c     ioptn = 3
c     call calndr (ioptn, 15, 10, 1582, julian)
c calndr() should return julian=2299161
c
c Find the Julian Day number for day 288 during 1582 AD.
c When the input is day number of the year, one should specify month=1
c     ioptn = 3
c     call calndr (ioptn, 288, 1, 1582, julian)
c calndr() should return dayct=2299161
c
c Find the date for Julian Day number 2299161.
c     ioptn = 4
c     call calndr (ioptn, iday, month, iyear, 2299161)
c calndr() should return iday=15, month=10, and iyear=1582
c 
c Find the day number during the year (iday) and year
c for Julian Day number 2299161.
c     ioptn = 5
c     call calndr (ioptn, iday, month, iyear, 2299161)
c calndr() should return iday=288, month=1, iyear=1582
c
c Given 15 October 1582 under the Gregorian calendar,
c find the date (idayJ,imonthJ,iyearJ) under the Julian calendar.
c To do this, we call calndr() twice, using the Julian Day number
c as the intermediate value.
c     call calndr ( 3, 15,        10, 1582,    julian)
c     call calndr (-4, idayJ, monthJ, iyearJ,  julian)
c The first call to calndr() should return julian=2299161, and
c the second should return idayJ=5, monthJ=10, iyearJ=1582
c
c----------
c
c BASIC CALENDAR INFORMATION
c
c The Julian calendar was instituted by Julius Caesar in 45 BC.
c Every fourth year is a leap year in which February has 29 days.
c That is, the Julian calendar assumes that the year is exactly
c 365.25 days long.  Actually, the year is not quite this long.
c The modern Gregorian calendar remedies this by omitting leap years
c in years divisible by 100 except when the year is divisible by 400.
c Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 are leap years under the Julian calendar
c but not under the Gregorian calendar.  The years 1600 and 2000 are
c leap years under both the Julian and the Gregorian calendars.
c Other years divisible by 4 are leap years under both calendars,
c such as 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, etc.  For BC years, we recall
c that year 0 was omitted, so 1 BC, 5 BC, 9 BC, 13 BC, etc., and 401 BC,
c 801 BC, 1201 BC, etc., are leap years under both calendars, while
c 101 BC, 201 BC, 301 BC, 501 BC, 601 BC, 701 BC, 901 BC, 1001 BC,
c 1101 BC, etc., are leap years under the Julian calendar but not
c the Gregorian calendar.
c
c The Gregorian calendar is named after Pope Gregory XIII.  He declared
c that the last day of the old Julian calendar would be Thursday,
c 4 October 1582 and that the following day, Friday, would be reckoned
c under the new calendar as 15 October 1582.  The jump of 10 days was
c included to make 21 March closer to the spring equinox.
c
c Only a few Catholic countries (Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain)
c switched to the Gregorian calendar on the day after 4 October 1582.
c It took other countries months to centuries to change to the
c Gregorian calendar.  For example, England's first day under the
c Gregorian calendar was 14 September 1752.  The same date applied to
c the entire British empire, including America.  Japan, Russia, and many
c eastern European countries did not change to the Gregorian calendar
c until the 20th century.  The last country to change was Turkey,
c which began using the Gregorian calendar on 1 January 1927.
c
c Therefore, between the years 1582 and 1926 AD, you must know
c the country in which an event was dated to interpret the date
c correctly.  In Sweden, there was even a year (1712) when February
c had 30 days.  Consult a book on calendars for more details
c about when various countries changed their calendars.
c
c DAY NUMBER DURING THE YEAR
c The day number during the year is simply a counter equal to 1 on
c 1 January, 32 on 1 February, etc., thorugh 365 or 366 on 31 December,
c depending on whether the year is a leap year.  Sometimes this is
c called the Julian Day, but that term is better reserved for the
c day counter explained below.
c
c JULIAN DAY NUMBER
c The Julian Day numbering system was designed by Joseph Scaliger
c in 1582 to remove ambiguity caused by varying calendar systems.
c The name "Julian Day" was chosen to honor Scaliger's father,
c Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484-1558), an Italian scholar and physician
c who lived in France.  Because Julian Day numbering was especially
c designed for astronomers, Julian Days begin at noon so that the day
c counter does not change in the middle of an astronmer's observing
c period.  Julian Day 0 began at noon on 1 January 4713 BC under the
c Julian calendar.  A modern reference point is that 23 May 1968
c (Gregorian calendar) was Julian Day 2,440,000.
c
c JULIAN DAY NUMBER EXAMPLES
c
c The table below shows a few Julian Day numbers and their corresponding
c dates, depending on which calendar is used.  A negative 'iyear' refers
c to BC (Before Christ).
c

c From this table, we can see that the 10 day difference between the
c two calendars in 1582 grew to 13 days by 1 March 1900, since 1900 was
c a leap year under the Julian calendar but not under the Gregorian
c calendar.  The gap will widen to 14 days after 1 March 2100 for the
c same reason.

c----------
c
c PORTABILITY
c
c This subroutine is written in standard FORTRAN 77.
c It calls no external functions or subroutines and should run
c without problem on any computer having a 32-bit word or longer.
c 
c----------
c
c ALGORITHM
c
c The goal in coding calndr() was clear, clean code, not efficiency.
c Calendar calculations usually take a trivial fraction of the time
c in any program in which dates conversions are involved.
c Data analysis usually takes the most time.
c
c Standard algorithms are followed in this subroutine.  Internal to
c this subroutine, we use a year counter "jyear" such that
c  jyear=iyear   when iyear is positive
c       =iyear+1 when iyear is negative.
c Thus, jyear does not experience a 1 year jump like iyear does
c when going from BC to AD.  Specifically, jyear=0 when iyear=-1,
c i.e., when the year is 1 BC.
c
c For simplicity in dealing with February, inside this subroutine,
c we let the year begin on 1 March so that the adjustable month,
c February is the last month of the year.
c It is clear that the calendar used to work this way because the
c months September, October, November, and December refer to
c 7, 8, 9, and 10.  For consistency, jyear is incremented on 1 March
c rather than on 1 January.  Of course, everything is adjusted back to
c standard practice of years beginning on 1 January before answers
c are returned to the routine that calls calndr().
c
c Lastly, we use a trick to calculate the number of days from 1 March
c until the end of the month that precedes the specified month.
c That number of days is int(30.6001*(month+1))-122,
c where 30.6001 is used to avoid the possibility of round-off and
c truncation error.  For example, if 30.6 were used instead,
c 30.6*5 should be 153, but round-off error could make it 152.99999,
c which would then truncated to 152, causing an error of 1 day.

c
c Explanation of all internal variables.
c jdref   Julian Day on which 1 March begins in the reference year.
c jmonth  Month counter which equals month+1 if month .gt. 2
c          or month+13 if month .le. 2.
c jyear   Year index,  jyear=iyear if iyear .gt. 0, jyear=iyear+1
c            if iyear .lt. 0.  Thus, jyear does not skip year 0
c            like iyear does between BC and AD years.
c leap    =1 if the year is a leap year, =0 if not.
c n1yr    Number of complete individual years between iyear and
c            the reference year after all 4, 100,
c            and 400 year periods have been removed.
c n4yr    Number of complete 4 year cycles between iyear and
c            the reference year after all 100 and 400 year periods
c            have been removed.
c n100yr  Number of complete 100 year periods between iyear and
c            the reference year after all 400 year periods
c            have been removed.
c n400yr  Number of complete 400 year periods between iyear and
c            the reference year.
c ndays   Number of days since 1 March during iyear.  (In intermediate
c            steps, it holds other day counts as well.)
c ndy400  Number of days in 400 years.  Under the Gregorian calendar,
c            this is 400*365 + 100 - 3 = 146097.  Under the Julian
c            calendar, this is 400*365 + 100 = 146100.
c ndy100  Number of days in 100 years,  Under the Gregorian calendar,
c            this is 100*365 + 24 = 36524.   Under the Julian calendar,
c            this is 100*365 + 25 = 36525.
c nyrs    Number of years from the beginning of yr400
c              to the beginning of jyear.  (Used for option +/-3).
c yr400   The largest multiple of 400 years that is .le. jyear.

               leap = 0
         endif
      endif
c
c Options 3-5 involve Julian Day numbers, which need a reference year
c and the Julian Days that began at noon on 1 March of the reference
c year under the Gregorian and Julian calendars.  Any year for which
c "jyear" is divisible by 400 can be used as a reference year.
c We chose 1600 AD as the reference year because it is the closest
c multiple of 400 to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, making
c it relatively easy to compute the Julian Day for 1 March 1600
c given that, on 15 October 1582 under the Gregorian calendar,
c the Julian Day was 2299161.  Similarly, we need to do the same
c calculation for the Julian calendar.  We can compute this Julian
c Day knwoing that on 4 October 1582 under the Julian calendar,
c the Julian Day number was 2299160.  The details of these calculations
c is next. 
c    From 15 October until 1 March, the number of days is the remainder
c of October plus the days in November, December, January, and February:
c 17+30+31+31+28 = 137, so 1 March 1583 under the Gregorian calendar
c was Julian Day 2,299,298.  Because of the 10 day jump ahead at the
c switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, 1 March
c 1583 under the Julian calendar was Julian Day 2,299,308.  Making use
c of the rules for the two calendar systems, 1 March 1600 was Julian
c Day 2,299,298 + (1600-1583)*365 + 5 (due to leap years) =
c 2,305,508 under the Gregorian calendar and day 2,305,518 under the
c Julian calendar.
c    We also set the number of days in 400 years and 100 years.
c For reference, 400 years is 146097 days under the Gregorian calendar
c and 146100 days under the Julian calendar.  100 years is 36524 days
c under the Gregorian calendar and 36525 days under the Julian calendar.
