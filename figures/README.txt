Code for generating GRADS figures from snowmodel output. 

> snod_sp.gs: generating a 2-D contour plot on a given 
	day of a given variable (i.e. SNOD)
> snod_ts.gs: generating a 1-D timeseries plot for a given date range
	for a given variable at a specific location in the model
	domain (i.e. SNOD @ cell i=120, j=194)
